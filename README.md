This project is the design of a small companion robot inspired by the Karotz/Nabaztag products.

Fancier website (wip): https://r1d1.github.io/KarotzLikeBot

Some ideas to use:
- use cron to generate random autonomous behaviors.
- ears/LED combination to animate.
- What final shape ? Rabbit, other animal, beholder (AD&D), floating robot/tau turret like robot.
- Use RPi most likely + Arduino Nano

Codename M.A.R.C.E.L
